# Catalog

![Meet Catalog](https://paszternak.me/content/catalog/catalog_screen8.jpg)

Catalog is a PHP + MySql application to manage your home library. If you don't care about who hosts your stuff, choose LibraryThing. If you want complex, almost library-like stuff, go for OpenBiblio, Koha or Evergreen. But if you want to own your book data and you would keep it simple without all the functionalities too much for an average user, Catalog is for you.

Read on, or see [the Catalog Wiki](https://github.com/psztrnk/catalog/wiki) for more information.

- add new books with

## Installation

2. Rename the top level folder to your liking (eg. `catalog`).
3. Upload the folder to the desired location on your web server.

## Roadmap

If developed further, the below features will be implemented to future versions of Catalog.
- [x] Ebook management. Implementing a `doctype`, possibly an upload functionality for ebook files. Would be nice to have a remote backup of my ebooks along with their data (Catalog already has blank columns in the database for this).
- [ ] Multi-user. Currently I don't really see the point in a multi-user application, but who knows. Catalog already has an unused `owner` column in the database.
